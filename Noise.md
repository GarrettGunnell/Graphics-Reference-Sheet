# Noise

Noise was developed as a solution to a problem related to random number generation, that 2 randomly generated numbers would be unrelated to one another. Noise, conceptually, is random patterns and numbers that are smooth and are mostly self similar, which emulates randomness in the real world. Within the context of computer graphics, this means blurring random values generated on a grid together to create smooth gradients.

## White Noise

White noise is a grid of generated numbers that are not blurred. Like a tv screen with no signal.
